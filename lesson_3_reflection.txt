When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
colaborating
showing to others
share code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

changes might come from some one else
don't need all branches locally

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

branch: for own existing project
to fix buggs, add features, documentation, etc.

clones: to copy an existing project
either mine or from somebody else
mostly just to use on local machine

fork: to copy project on github
to change or use without affecting original

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

to identify what other people changed/added remotely


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

if many people work together it would be really hard
hard to make forks and see differences
every one has to change files locally and them compare

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
