How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

at first hard to read
need some getting used to
much faster than manual
especially for large files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

learn from past mistakes
easier to fix mistakes
try out things faster

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros:
can choose right size
can choose meaningfull commits
can choose logical commits

cons:
user error
might forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

multi-file - coding and other connnected documents
multi-file - more resources
single file coommit - normal documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log show changes made between commits as comments
git diff use 2 commits to show changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

can always go back when I do mistake
can easily find where I did mistake
can't break old working code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

all my programming
